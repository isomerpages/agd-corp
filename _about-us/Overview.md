report&nbsp;Singapore’s reserves&nbsp;position, fulfilling the Accountant-General’s
statutory duty to safeguard reserves.</p>
<h5>Fiscal sustainability</h5>
<p>Even as the Government pledges to take better care of Singaporeans through

of prudence&nbsp;within the public sector while meeting the increasing
expectations of the public.</p>
<h5>Accountability for performance</h5>
<p>We perform&nbsp;financial management reporting and analysis&nbsp;to ensure
