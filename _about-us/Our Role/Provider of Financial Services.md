<h1>Provider of Financial Services</h1>
<h3>Providing Integrated Government Accounting Systems</h3>
<p>We equip Ministries with an integrated set of systems, policies, procedures,
and advisory services for financial administration and accounting. We also
develop and manage civil service-wide financial, accounting, and payroll
systems. This function involves formulating security policies and controls
to ensure the integrity of these systems.</p>
<h3>Managing Government Funds and Cash Flow</h3>
<p>We manage the Government’s cash, receipts, and payments to vendors, employees,
and pensioners and ensure that the payments are efficiently processed.</p>
<h3>Providing Value-adding Financial and Internal Audit Services </h3>
<p>We support the financial functions of Ministries&nbsp;and Statutory Boards&nbsp;by
deploying our officers and provide strategic inputs to Senior Management.</p>
<p>We provide internal audit services to Government agencies in order to
strengthen controls, systems, and processes. The Assurance team taps on
analytics to strengthen risk management and controls in the Public Sector.</p>
<h3>Leveraging Technology to Build New Financial Capabilities</h3>
<p>We leverage technology to enhance the functionalities of our central financial
systems to serve the needs of our end users better. For example, we make
use of application programming interface (API) to retrieve real-time data
for auto-population of the vendor record form at Vendors@Gov to reduce
manual data entry required of system users. We have also integrated our
central financial systems with other central relevant Government and external
systems via two-way interfaces to enable automated sharing of information
and ensuring timely and accurate processing and service delivery. For example,
Vendors@Gov interfaces e-invoices to agencies’ financial systems for processing,
and agencies’ systems will interface the e-invoice statuses back to Vendors@Gov
to keep vendors updated.</p>
