For 6 years after independence in 1965, AGD took on responsibilities of a “Central Banker” and performed the roles of Registrar of Loans, Deputy Foreign Exchange Controller and Commissioner of Banking. These functions were transferred from AGD to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) when it was formed in 1971.

### 1995

### 1999

* #### Launch of the New Financial System (NFS@Gov)

	The New Financial System (NFS@Gov) supports a wide range of mission-critical functions for the Whole-of-Government. This new system was initially developed as AGD’s solution to the worldwide millennium bug issue, instead of revising the system to a Y2K-compliant one. Currently, this integrated system provides budgeting, accounting, and financial management services, which cuts across agencies, operational processes and technology. The system has radically streamlined Government’s financial processes by leveraging on technology.

### 2000

* #### Ms Chua Geok Wah as Accountant-General
	Ms Chua Geok Wah took over the role of Accountant-General for 15 years.
* #### Launch of the Pay and Claims System (PaC@Gov)
	PaC@Gov eliminated the need for physical pay slips and claim forms. The automated payroll system now allows civil servants to view their pay for the past 12 months, the year-to-date balance, and other information. They are also able to submit claims electronically, which results in time savings and reduces paperwork.

### 2004

* #### Launch of Vendors@Gov

	Vendors@Gov is a secured one-stop online portal that allows Government vendors to conveniently submit and track the status of their E-invoices, enquire and update payment status and details anytime, anywhere across the globe. E-invoicing also enables suppliers to cut down on paper use. Prior to this, the Government would receive over 600,000 invoices from suppliers a year, equivalent to 1.35 million sheets of paper.

	One of the value-adding innovations embedded within Vendors@Gov is the Bank Account Validation System (BAVS). Previously, vendors had to make personal trips to their banks for verification of bank account details GIRO application forms. To make it hassle-free, AGD worked with banks, Accounting & Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to automate the validation of vendors’ bank accounts. This had saved much time and effort for multiple parties – vendors, banks, ministries and AGD.

### 2005

* #### Provision of Assurance Services to External Agencies

	AGD Internal Audit team began extending its internal audit service offerings to external agencies, providing services to 2 agencies for a start. The team assists clients to examine and evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of their internal controls in responding to organisational risks.

	The Act empowers the Accountant-General to establish accounting standards for Statutory Boards, which required Statutory Board to prepare its financial statements in compliance with the accounting standards established by the Accountant-General.	
	
* #### Setting up of the Value-for-Money (VFM) Review Office

	The VFM Review Office was set up by Cabinet to examine whether Government expenditures are achieving their intended outcomes in a cost-efficient manner.

	With more autonomy given to Ministries in budgetary allocation and discretion over expenditures, there would be a need for measures to ensure greater accountability and signal emphasis on VFM in the use of public funds. As such, the objective of the VFM Review Office is to systematically evaluate the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending on programmes and activities of Ministries and Statutory Boards.
	
* #### Launch of Demand Aggregation (DA) Scheme for Investments

	The Demand Aggregation (DA) scheme was launched to provide an option for Ministries and Statutory Boards that would like to engage fund managers to manage their surpluses or trust monies. This initiative seeks to demand-aggregate investments so that agencies can enjoy economies of scale and gain easy access to professional fund management and investment consultancy services.

### 2009

* #### Implementation of Centralised Liquidity Management (CLM)
