## Partner of Building Capabilities


### Building Financial Competencies

We work in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Public Service Division in strengthening the financial competencies of the officers in the Public Sector. AGD has also looked into growing the capabilities of AGD officers and the wider Public Sector finance community through the development of training programmes.

### Developing Finance Leaders for the Public Sector

We help to manage the professional and career development of the finance professionals with the view of attracting and developing them.

### Sharing through Communities of Financial Practice

We will share best practices among public sector financial officers through initiating communities of financial practice in the areas of internal audit, financial management etc. The Centre of Excellence in Assurance & Public Finance will drive key initiatives to deepen the sectoral capabilities of financial officers and ensure their continual engagement and professional development. We will strengthen public finance capabilities in land and infrastructure, security and resilience, social and economic sectors, with a view to building competent finance teams serving the government agencies.
