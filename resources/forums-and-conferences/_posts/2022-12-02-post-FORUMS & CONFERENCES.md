The theme for this year’s IART – ‘Building a Professional and Collaborative Public Sector IA Community’ articulates the Public Sector Internal Audit (PSIA) community collective transformation journey to be the trusted advisor in strengthening governance within public sector. 

In the Digital Age, technology continues to change at nearly the speed of light with no signs of slowing down. The PSIA community is transforming from the position of strength boldly so as to stay ahead of the curve. Representatives from Accountant-General’s Department, Auditor’s General’s Office, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, and Ministry of Defence spoke at the event, sharing key community initiatives such as digitalisation blueprint and benchmarking of public sector internal audit to global audit practices.
