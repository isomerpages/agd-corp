<h4><strong>1965</strong></h4>
<p>• AGD as the “Central Banker”</p>
<p>The Accountant-General's Department came under Singapore Government’s
authority, as a department of Ministry of Finance. For 6 years after independence
in 1965, AGD took on responsibilities of a “Central Banker” and performed
the roles of Registrar of Loans, Deputy Foreign Exchange Controller and
Commissioner of Banking. These functions were transferred from AGD to the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) when it was formed in 1971.</p>
<h4><strong>1947</strong></h4>
<p>• Preparation of First Set of Financial Statements for the Crown Colony
of Singapore</p>
<p>Mr N. M. Kennedy took over in 1947 and prepared the first set of financial
statements for the Crown Colony of Singapore for the year 1946.</p>
<h4><strong>1867</strong></h4>
<p>• Establishment of the Crown Colony of the British Empire</p>
<p>This was the year that the Straits Settlements were made a Crown Colony
of the British Empire. During this period, the Lieutenant-Governor of Penang
reported on the revenue and expenditure of the settlements. Mr William
Willans Willans was the Treasurer for the Crown Colony.</p>

<h4><strong>2022</strong></h4>
<p>• Singapore Chartered Account (CA)</p>
<p>Accountant-General's Department is now accredited to be an ATO under the
Singapore Chartered Accountant (CA) Qualification framework and is now
authorized to train candidates in their journey towards achieving CA (Singapore)
designation for the next three years (expiry 26 January 2026).</p>
<h4><strong>2018</strong></h4>
<p>• AGD is awarded SQC - Star for making significant improvements in the
business excellence journey.</p>
<p>• Head of Profession for Finance</p>
<p>Accountant-General has been appointed as the Head of Profession for Finance
to professionalise finance officers working in the public sector.</p>
<h4><strong>2017</strong></h4>
<p>• Launch of Pac@Gov Mobile App</p>
<p>Pac@Gov Mobile App allows public officers to view their pay information,
submit claims and apply leave on-the-go.</p>
<h4><strong>2016</strong></h4>
<p>• Launch of Fi@Gov</p>
<p>Fi@Gov is the public sector’s one stop financial analytics platform that
provides insights and analysis for decision making, performance monitoring
and governance.</p>
<p>• Launch of Vendors@Gov Mobile App</p>
<p>Vendors@Gov Mobile App allows vendors to view their invoice statuses on-the-go,
check their projected cash flows and receive notifications, in addition
to functions that already exist on the Vendors@Gov portal.</p>
<p>• Setting up of the Finance Academy</p>
<p>The Finance Academy serves as the training arm of the department to provide
relevant training to our officers. The Academy also extends our training
programmes to the public sector finance community to raise the capabilities
of finance officers.</p>
<h4><strong>2009</strong></h4>
<p>• Implementation of Centralised Liquidity Management (CLM)</p>
<p>Through the CLM initiative, AGD centralises excess cash held by Statutory
Board, manages and invests the excess cash on their behalf, generating
higher returns on SBs’ cash and brings about substantial savings and efficiency
gains for the public sector.</p>
<h4><strong>2007</strong></h4>
<p>• Launch of the Pensioner’s Portal</p>
<p>The portal provides Government pensioners with convenient access to useful
pension-related information any time. Pensioners are able to view their
pension advice for the past 2 years, as well as their medical and dental
claims that will be updated on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>• Establishing Accounting Standards for Statutory Boards</p>
<p>The Act empowers the Accountant-General to establish accounting standards
for Statutory Boards, which required Statutory Board to prepare its financial
statements in compliance with the accounting standards established by the
Accountant-General.</p>
<p>• Setting up of the Value-for-Money (VFM) Review Office</p>
<p>The VFM Review Office was set up by Cabinet to examine whether Government
expenditures are achieving their intended outcomes in a cost-efficient
manner.</p>
<p>With more autonomy given to Ministries in budgetary allocation and discretion
over expenditures, there would be a need for measures to ensure greater
accountability and signal emphasis on VFM in the use of public funds. As
such, the objective of the VFM Review Office is to systematically evaluate
the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending on programmes and
activities of Ministries and Statutory Boards.</p>
<p>• Launch of Demand Aggregation (DA) Scheme for Investments</p>
<p>The Demand Aggregation (DA) scheme was launched to provide an option for
Ministries and Statutory Boards that would like to engage fund managers
to manage their surpluses or trust monies. This initiative seeks to demand-aggregate
investments so that agencies can enjoy economies of scale and gain easy
access to professional fund management and investment consultancy services.</p>
<h4><strong>2006</strong></h4>
<p>• Introduction of the Medical Billing System (MBS@Gov)</p>
<p>Through MBS@Gov, private clinics are able to efficiently submit claims
for the Government’s share of medical bills incurred by civil servants,
pensioners and their dependants at the clinics.</p>
<h4><strong>2005</strong></h4>
<p>• Provision of Assurance Services to External Agencies</p>
<p>AGD Internal Audit team began extending its internal audit service offerings
to external agencies, providing services to 2 agencies for a start. The
team assists clients to examine and evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness
of their internal controls in responding to organisational risks.</p>
<h4><strong>2004</strong></h4>
<p>• Launch of Vendors@Gov</p>
<p>Vendors@Gov is a secured one-stop online portal that allows Government
vendors to conveniently submit and track the status of their E-invoices,
enquire and update payment status and details anytime, anywhere across
the globe. E-invoicing also enables suppliers to cut down on paper use.
Prior to this, the Government would receive over 600,000 invoices from
suppliers a year, equivalent to 1.35 million sheets of paper.</p>
<p>One of the value-adding innovations embedded within Vendors@Gov is the
Bank Account Validation System (BAVS). Previously, vendors had to make
personal trips to their banks for verification of bank account details
GIRO application forms. To make it hassle-free, AGD worked with banks,
Accounting &amp; Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) and the Immigration
&amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to automate the validation of vendors’
bank accounts. This had saved much time and effort for multiple parties
– vendors, banks, ministries and AGD.</p>
<h4><strong>2000</strong></h4>
<p>• Launch of the Pay and Claims System (PaC@Gov)</p>
<p>PaC@Gov eliminated the need for physical pay slips and claim forms. The
automated payroll system now allows civil servants to view their pay for
the past 12 months, the year-to-date balance, and other information. They
are also able to submit claims electronically, which results in time savings
and reduces paperwork.</p>
<h4><strong>1999</strong></h4>
<p>• Launch of the New Financial System (NFS@Gov)</p>
<p>The New Financial System (NFS@Gov) supports a wide range of mission-critical
functions for the Whole-of-Government. This new system was initially developed
as AGD’s solution to the worldwide millennium bug issue, instead of revising
the system to a Y2K-compliant one. Currently, this integrated system provides
budgeting, accounting, and financial management services, which cuts across
agencies, operational processes and technology. The system has radically
streamlined Government’s financial processes by leveraging on technology.</p>
<h4><strong>1988</strong></h4>
<p>• Presentation of the White Paper</p>
<p>The first White Paper on the protection of reserves was first conceived
in 1988. AGD played a significant role in developing the initial set of
principles and guidelines safeguarding past reserves.</p>
<h4><strong>1987</strong></h4>
<p>• Enactment of the Accountants Act</p>
<p>The enactment of the Accountants Act resulted in the splitting of the
Singapore Society of Accountants into two separate entities – Public Accountants
Board and Institute of Certified Public Accountants.</p>
