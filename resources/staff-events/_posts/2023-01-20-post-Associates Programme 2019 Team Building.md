On 18Jun 2019, a group of AGD officers took part in a Goalball and Dragon boating Team building session as part of the 2019 Associates Programme. Our officers got to experience an official Paralympic sport initially designed to help rehabilitate blind war veterans. On top of that, they also learnt about how dragon boating is being made accessible for the Deaf community and even got to learn the basics of sign language.
