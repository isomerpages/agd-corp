<h3>Expanded Induction Programme</h3>
<p>The expanded induction programme comprises three modules - Basic, Foundational
and Developmental – which the Finance Associates will undergo in their
first year with AGD.&nbsp; The different modules are specially tailored
to equip our Associates with rudimentary concepts in Public Finance functions
and to apply these concepts throughout their deployment stints.</p>
<p>The Basic module, conducted at the start of the programme, will provide
the Finance Associates with a broad overview of AGD’s central roles such
as cash management, financial reporting, assurance and Value-For-Money
reviews and financial administration.
<br>The Foundational module, conducted in between the deployment stints of
the Finance Associates, will focus on the applications of key foundational
financial knowledge and skillsets as well as soft skills developments through
case studies and hands-on exercises.</p>
<p>The Developmental module, conducted at the end of the 12-month programme,
will introduce the Finance Associates to core personal and professional
development areas through the sharing of best practices and chats with
senior policy-makers and finance leaders.</p>
<h3>Deployment Stints</h3>
<p>The deployment stints of Finance Associates will include attachments to
AGD’s directorates to learn more about the central roles and functions
fulfilled by AGD.&nbsp; Some Finance Associates may also be attached to
ministries and statutory boards to provide financial administration support.</p>
<h3>Mentoring</h3>

</div>
<p>To help the Finance Associates quickly familiarise with the working environment,
we will assign a buddy to provide support and answer any queries while
settling into the new job.</p>
<p>At the same time, we will assign mentors to all of our Finance Associates.
Besides providing guidance on the professional development and career aspirations,
the mentors will also help assess the performance and progress of associates.</p>
<h3>Post Associates Programme</h3>
<p>There will be 2 to 3 structured postings, within AGD and/or the ministries
and statutory boards, in the first six to seven years to equip Finance
Associates with the necessary experiences and skillsets through a spectrum
of functions and areas to prepare them to take on supervisory roles in
the future.</p>
