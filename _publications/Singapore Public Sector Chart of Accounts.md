<h1>Singapore Public Sector Chart of Accounts</h1>
<p>The Accountant-General’s Department (AGD) has developed a new Singapore
Public Sector Chart of Accounts (PS-COA) for public sector agencies, i.e.
Ministries, Organs of State and Statutory Boards, to standardise the account
code structure used to classify and record financial transactions across
the Public Sector. From FY2026, Ministries and Organs of State will adopt
the PS-COA when presenting their estimates in the Revenue and Expenditure
Estimates and AGD will use the PS-COA to prepare the Government Financial
Statements. The paper below provides technical details of the PS-COA.</p>
