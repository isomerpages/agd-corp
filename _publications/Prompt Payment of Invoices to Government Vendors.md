<p>The Government is committed to paying our suppliers promptly. It is a
key part of our pro-enterprise approach, and timely payments help business
manage their cost and cashflows.</p>
<p>The Government maintains a target KPI of 95% prompt payment rate, which
we have achieved consistently over the last few years. More details on
the historical prompt payment rates can be found <a href="/files/Prompt_Payment_Publication.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here.</a>
</p>
<p>Achieving consistent prompt payment requires a collective effort between
Government agencies and their vendors, working together to strike a balance
between internal control checks and speed of payment. We thank our vendors
and agencies for their continued cooperation and encourage this collaborative
approach to ensure a smooth billing process for all parties.</p>
