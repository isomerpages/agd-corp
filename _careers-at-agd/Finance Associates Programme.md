Finance Associates Programme
============================

The Finance Associates Programme is our flagship programme for new hires. The Programme allows our associates to systematically acquire strong foundations in key domain areas of finance, operations and policy formulation across the Whole-of-Government.  
  
Fresh graduates joining AGD under the programme will undergo a 12-month developmental phase comprising an expanded induction programme and 2 to 3 rotational stints of 4 - 6 months each across different finance functions. This will allow them to build up their competencies and accelerate career development as well as to take on leadership responsibilities early in their career.
