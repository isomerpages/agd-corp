while ensuring optimal management of Singapore's balance sheet. Our work
includes reviewing investment management rules, strengthening governance

greater social outlays, it is imperative that we continue to promote the
fiscal sustainability of Singapore. We seek to&nbsp;engender a culture
of prudence&nbsp;within the public sector while meeting the increasing
expectations of the public.</p>
<h5>Accountability for performance</h5>

that Government agencies are held accountable, using efficient&nbsp;data
analytics&nbsp;to aid management in its decision-making processes.</p>
