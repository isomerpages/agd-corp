Congratulations to AGD on clinching the SHARE Platinum Award again this year. The Community Chest Award Ceremony 2019 was held at the Istana on 9 Oct 2019. The award recognises organisations with high employee SHARE participation rate. We would like to thank all AGD officers for their continued support through their contributions to the Community chest.
