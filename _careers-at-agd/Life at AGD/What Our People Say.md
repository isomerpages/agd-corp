<p>“If I were to sum up my journey as an AGD scholar in three words, it would
be ‘exposure’, ‘rigour’ and ‘fulfilment’.”
<br>
<br><strong>Justin Kong</strong>
<br>Head, Economics Programmes 2
<br>Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>I joined AGD in 2014 under the Financial and Management Reporting Directorate
which had the key responsibility of preparing the Government Financial
Statements. To facilitate meaningful and reliable reporting, I was involved
in reviewing and improving the central accounting systems, processes and
rules. This enabled me to have a bird’s eye view of the Government’s finances.</p>
<p>My second posting in 2017 was to the Treasury Directorate where I worked
with the Ministry of Finance to ensure proper management of the Government’s
assets, liabilities and reserves. The Treasury Directorate also supports
the Accountant-General in reporting on the reserves position to the President
and informing the President of any proposed transaction that is likely
to draw on past reserves.</p>
<p>These roles became starkly critical when COVID-19 struck and they had
to seek the President’s approval to draw on the reserves. They had to ensure
sufficient resources were available for the roll-out of support measures
while maintaining proper safeguards as they handled unprecedented circumstances.
I was also roped into the preparation of the multiple budgets that they
had during the crisis. Knowing how my work would benefit fellow Singaporeans,
this spurred me on throughout the many late-night work sessions and kept
the teamwork strong.</p>
<p>I am currently seconded to the Economic Programmes (EP) Directorate under
the Ministry of Finance which plays an important role in the allocation
of fiscal and other financial resources across economic programmes to support
the nation’s economic priorities. The team (EP2) is involved in areas such
as resourcing and supporting Singapore’s energy resilience and security,
energy transition and decarbonisation journey. His team also play a role
in facilitating business’ access to capital through means such as equity,
debt and project financing. Being exposed to policy work covering a diverse
range of issues has been an enriching experience. Knowing that our work
can make a positive impact on Singapore’s economy and society makes it
all the more fulfilling.</p>

<p>“AGD Accountancy Scholarship gave me the opportunity to excel more than
just being a student but as a leader and an aspiring civil servant.”
<br>
<br><strong>Macus Lim</strong>
<br>AGD Accountancy Scholar</p>
<p>Coming from a lower – middle income family, I am always grateful to Singapore’s
education system and its system of meritocracy where everyone is given
the opportunity to succeed based on one’s ability rather than socioeconomic
status.</p>
<p>As such, I have always been looking for an opportunity to give back to
the society. This opportunity came when I was choosing a scholarship after
my GCSE A Level – I decided to take up the AGD Accountancy Scholarship
in 2017.</p>
<p>The AGD Accountancy Scholarship has allowed me to maximise my full potential
beyond academics, without having to fret over financial concerns. Because
of this enabler, I was able to take up multiple leadership positions in
the university. I was also assigned an AGD buddy as well as a mentor who
would address any queries I had and provide me with advice on various matters.
I was constantly engaged and invited to attend corporate activities such
as AGD Dinner and Dance, AGD Annual Advance, etc during my term of study.</p>
<p>In May 2021, I interned in AGD’s Finance Transformation Directorate and
worked on the Cumulus project which aims to harness the new cloud technology
to realise productivity and efficiency improvements for Finance, HR and
Payroll processes in the Statutory Boards. This internship has given me
a broad understanding of how AGD is able to empower the rest of the public
service as a leader in transforming Public Sector Finance.</p>

<p>“AGD can be characterised by its strong company culture, diverse individuals
and career prospects that spurs personal growth.””
<br>
<br><strong>Vera Lim</strong>
<br>PSC Public Finance Scholar</p>
<p>As part of my internship, I was attached to the Financial Transformation
team which is responsible for the implementation of a harmonised and centralised
financial system for the Whole-Of-Government.</p>
<p>I was involved in providing roving support to an agency as their employees
came onboard the new financial system. Concurrently, I was also working
with the team to implement and integrate the new system to agencies in
the later project phase.</p>
<p>Throughout my attachment, I have been welcomed by colleagues despite the
physical restrictions and work from home arrangements. We celebrated key
milestones together and explored new ideas of change management and stakeholder
management. AGD builds a strong rapport with scholars through mentorship
and hosting various events such as Annual Advance that allow us to mingle
and interact with fellow colleagues and scholars.</p>
<p>As AGD values unique experiences, skills and ideas that each individual
brings, they have been supportive of my co-curriculum activities, internships
and exchange programme. These invaluable takeaways help me to grow professionally
and personally, ultimately preparing me to serve in the public sector.</p>
