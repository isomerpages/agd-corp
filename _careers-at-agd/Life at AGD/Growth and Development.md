<h1>Growth and Development</h1>
<p></p>
<p>We have put in place an integrated learning and development framework
aimed at developing the professional competencies of our officers and strengthening
our career value proposition as an employer. The framework underpins our
commitment to nurture our people to their fullest potential.</p>
<p>At AGD, we believe in developing our people through continuous learning
and are committed to investing resources and time to support their professional
and personal growth. We also provide our officers with opportunities to
acquire different skills and knowledge in various areas of work through
job rotation and project work.</p>
