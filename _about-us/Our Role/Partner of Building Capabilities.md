<h2>Partner of Building Capabilities</h2>
<h3>Building Financial Competencies</h3>
<p>We work in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Public Service
Division in strengthening the financial competencies of the officers in
the Public Sector. AGD has also looked into growing the capabilities of
AGD officers and the wider Public Sector finance community through the
development of training programmes.</p>
<h3>Developing Finance and Internal Audit Leaders for the Public Sector</h3>
<p>We help to manage the professional and career development of finance and
internal audit professionals with the aim of attracting and developing
them. Our development approach includes both short-term and long-term out-of-agency
stints such as structured job rotations, short-term immersion programmes,
gig projects, and talent attachment stints. To build a strong leadership
pipeline, we implement robust succession planning for key finance and internal
audit positions and provide targeted development opportunities for promising
officers. Our role extends beyond talent development; we collaborate with
agencies to establish industry standards and design optimal finance and
internal audit structures that maximise their potential.</p>
<h3>Sharing through Communities of Financial Practice</h3>
<p>We will share best practices among public sector financial officers through
initiating communities of financial practice in the areas of internal audit,
financial management etc. The functional leadership in Assurance &amp;
Public Finance will drive key initiatives to deepen the sectoral capabilities
of financial officers and ensure their continual engagement and professional
development. We will strengthen public finance capabilities with a view
to building competent finance teams across government agencies.</p>
