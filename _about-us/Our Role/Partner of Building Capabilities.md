<h2>Partner of Building Capabilities</h2>
<h3>Building Financial Competencies</h3>
<p>We work in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Public Service
Division in strengthening the financial competencies of the officers in
the Public Sector. AGD has also looked into growing the capabilities of
AGD officers and the wider Public Sector finance community through the
development of training programmes.</p>
<h3>Developing Finance Leaders for the Public Sector</h3>
<p>We help to manage the professional and career development of finance professionals
with the aim of attracting and developing them. Our development approach
includes both short-term and long-term out-of-agency stints such as structured
job rotations, short-term immersion programmes, gig projects, and talent
attachment stints. To build a strong leadership pipeline, we implement
robust succession planning for key finance positions and provide targeted
development opportunities for promising officers. Our role extends beyond
talent development; we collaborate with agencies to establish industry
standards and design optimal finance structures that maximise their potential.</p>
<h3>Sharing through Communities of Financial Practice</h3>
<p>We will share best practices among public sector financial officers through
initiating communities of financial practice in the areas of internal audit,
financial management etc. The Centre of Excellence in Assurance &amp; Public
Finance will drive key initiatives to deepen the sectoral capabilities
of financial officers and ensure their continual engagement and professional
development. We will strengthen public finance capabilities in land and
infrastructure, security and resilience, social and economic sectors, with
a view to building competent finance teams serving the government agencies.</p>
