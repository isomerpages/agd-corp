<h1>Pensioner's FAQ</h1>
<h4>How can I apply for my electronic Civil Service card (e-CS card)?</h4>
<p>Pensioners and dependants can produce their e-CS cards at Government,
Restructured or Community Hospitals, Polyclinics and MBS@Gov clinics, to
enjoy the benefits of not having to pay for their treatment upfront. To
apply for the e-CS card, pensioners can login to HRP Portal using SingPass
and submit a request for e-CS card. Pensioners will be required to indicate
their preferred email in the request to receive the e-CS card.</p>
<h4>From my bank statement, I noticed that there is a deduction from my monthly pensions and would like to understand the reasons for it. How can I view the breakdown of my monthly pensions?</h4>
<p>Depending on your medical scheme, you may have deductions for the co-payment
share of your medical bills. Pensioners can refer to their Statement of
Account for the breakdown of their monthly pensions. The Statement of Account
can be retrieved from Pensioner Portal or HRP Portal after payday at the
end of the month. For more information on your pension and medical benefits,
you may also refer to the Pensioner’s Handbook, which can be downloaded
from Pensioner Portal.</p>
<h4>As a pensioner, do I need to pay for consultation fees when I visit a specialist outpatient clinic?</h4>
<p>If you are under the Fixed Amount on Ward Charges (FAW) or Co-Payment
on Ward Charges (CPW) scheme, we will not subsidise your first consultation
at a specialist outpatient clinic if you or your dependants:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>have no referral letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>were referred by a private doctor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asked to see a specified consultant; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>were referred to a named consultant</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are under the Comprehensive Co-Payment Scheme (CCS) or Medisave-cum-Subsidised
Outpatient Scheme (MSO), we will not subsidise your first consultation
at a specialist outpatient clinic if you or your dependants do not have
a referral letter.</p>
