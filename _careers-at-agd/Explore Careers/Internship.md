==========

We offer internship programs to undergraduates who wish to gain experience in accounting and finance related work in the Public Sector.

Under this programme, interns will get the opportunity to work in a wide variety of challenging projects, gaining valuable and practical work experience. The internship experience will also help them develop an interdisciplinary perspective, giving them a significant edge when seeking future employment.

**Under the internship program, opportunities include:**

*   Participate in reviews of how Government operates and whether Government's spending is value-for-money. This involves going for field trips and external meetings;
*   Participate in research projects on international developments;
*   Work with our officers on various projects such as Data Analytics and Benchmarking of Financial Processes and Functions; and
*   Present the outcome at management or senior management level.
