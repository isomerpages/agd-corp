#### How can I apply for my electronic Civil Service card (e-CS card)?

Pensioners and dependants can produce their e-CS cards at Government, Restructured or Community Hospitals, Polyclinics and MBS@Gov clinics, to enjoy the benefits of not having to pay for their treatment upfront. To apply for the e-CS card, pensioners can login to PaC@Gov mobile app using SingPass and submit a request for e-CS card. Pensioners will be required to indicate their preferred email in the request to receive the e-CS card.

#### From my bank statement, I noticed that there is a deduction from my monthly pensions and would like to understand the reasons for it. How can I view the breakdown of my monthly pensions?

Depending on your medical scheme, you may have deductions for the co-payment share of your medical bills. Pensioners can refer to their Statement of Account for the breakdown of their monthly pensions. The Statement of Account can be retrieved from Pensioner Portal or PaC@Gov mobile app after payday at the end of the month. For more information on your pension and medical benefits, you may also refer to the Pensioner’s Handbook, which can be downloaded from Pensioner Portal.

#### As a pensioner, do I need to pay for consultation fees when I visit a specialist outpatient clinic?

If you are under the Fixed Amount on Ward Charges (FAW) or Co-Payment on Ward Charges (CPW) scheme, we will not subsidise your first consultation at a specialist outpatient clinic if you or your dependants:

*   have no referral letter
*   were referred by a private doctor
*   asked to see a specified consultant; or
*   were referred to a named consultant

If you are under the Comprehensive Co-Payment Scheme (CCS) or Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient Scheme (MSO), we will not subsidise your first consultation at a specialist outpatient clinic if you or your dependants do not have a referral letter.
