Provider of Financial Services
==============================

### Providing Integrated Government Accounting Systems

We equip Ministries with an integrated set of systems, policies, procedures, and advisory services for financial administration and accounting. We also develop and manage civil service-wide financial, accounting, and payroll systems. This function involves formulating security policies and controls to ensure the integrity of these systems.

### Managing Government Funds and Cash Flow

We manage the Government’s cash, receipts, and payments to vendors, employees, and pensioners and ensure that the payments are efficiently processed.

### Providing Value-adding Financial Services Through Demand Aggregation

We support the financial functions of Ministries and Statutory Boards by deploying our officers and supply strategic inputs to Senior Management.  
  
We provide internal audit services to Government agencies in order to strengthen controls, systems, and processes. The Assurance team taps on analytics to strengthen risk management and controls in the Public Sector. Demand aggregation of fund management services allows Statutory Boards to enjoy lower management fees and leads to manpower savings.

### Leveraging Technology to Build New Financial Capabilities

We leverage technology to enhance the functionalities of our central financial systems to serve the needs of our end users better. For example, we make use of application programming interface (API) to retrieve real-time data for auto-population of the vendor record form at Vendors@Gov to reduce manual data entry required of system users. We have also integrated our central financial systems with other central relevant Government and external systems via two-way interfaces to enable automated sharing of information and ensuring timely and accurate processing and service delivery. For example, Vendors@Gov interfaces e-invoices to agencies’ financial systems for processing, and agencies’ systems will interface the e-invoice statuses back to Vendors@Gov to keep vendors updated.
