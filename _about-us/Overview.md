policies&nbsp;and value-for-money reviews; we benchmark our resource management
framework with the leading jurisdictions and strive to learn from the best
practices. We monitor and report&nbsp;Singapore’s reserves&nbsp;position,
fulfilling the Accountant-General’s statutory duty to safeguard reserves.</p>
<h5>Fiscal sustainability</h5>
<p>Even as the Government pledges to take better care of Singaporeans through
greater social outlays, it is imperative that we continue to promote the
fiscal sustainability of Singapore. We seek to&nbsp;engender a culture
of prudence&nbsp;within the public sector while meeting the increasing
expectations of the public.</p>
<h5>Accountability for performance</h5>
<p>We perform&nbsp;financial management reporting and analysis&nbsp;to ensure
that Government agencies are held accountable, using efficient&nbsp;data
analytics&nbsp;to aid management in its decision-making processes.</p>

technology to keep abreast of the latest trends in innovation and achieve
transformation. With tighter integration of&nbsp;Government financial systems,
