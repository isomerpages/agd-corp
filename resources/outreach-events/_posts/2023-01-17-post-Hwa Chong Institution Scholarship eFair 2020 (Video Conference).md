On 15 July 2020, the AGD HR team took part in the Hwa Chong Institution Scholarship e-Fair. While the AGD team usually sets up physical booths at the annual scholarship fair, we had to improvise our outreach efforts during this COVID-19 period by having the sharing session conducted via virtual conferencing.Â   
  
Such a virtual outreach mode allowed AGD colleagues who were Hwa Chong alumni to share with the students more about the profile of AGD, the scholarships available, and our flagship developmental programme - the Finance Associates Programme. The key insights shared with the students included the role of the programme in building the talent pipeline for Public Sector Finance through the career value proposition of "One Career, Many Opportunities".
