<h1>AGD Social Compact</h1>
<p>AGD’s social compact is underpinned by the principles of:</p>
<p><strong>Building Trust, Embracing Diversity and Encouraging Open Communication</strong>
</p>
<p>We understand and respect that everyone in AGD is different, not only
in personal beliefs and preferences but also in working habits and styles.
We build trust through open communications and are committed to living
out the shared AGD values and culture of being Purpose-driven, People-centric
and Performance-oriented.</p>
<p><strong>Cultivating Collaboration and Professionalism</strong>
</p>
<p>Collaboration underpins our success to progress together as OneAGD. To
foster teamwork and innovation, we encourage collaboration and cross-pollination
of ideas through inter-directorate and cross-functional projects. We strive
to understand each other’s perspectives in an amicable and transparent
manner, challenging each other constructively to achieve better outcomes.
Through different postings within AGD and the wider public service, we
ensure a rich exchange of knowledge and skills, nurturing a vibrant work
environment.</p>
<p><strong>Caring and Showing Appreciation Towards One Another</strong>
</p>
<p>We show appreciation and empathy to one another, prioritising mutual support
during difficult periods. This culture of empathy and care creates a positive
workplace atmosphere where everyone feels empowered to contribute their
best and to help one another.</p>
