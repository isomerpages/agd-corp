Career Development Framework
============================

We have put in place an integrated career development framework aimed at developing the professional competencies of our officers and strengthening our career value proposition as an employer. The framework underpins our commitment to nurture our people to their fullest potential.

As part of the career development programme, we have put in place a structured posting process for AGD officers to systematically expand their competencies across the wide range of central functions and responsibilities. Regular career conversations will be conducted between AGD officers and their supervisors to try to better match the personal aspirations of the officers with the needs of the organisation.
