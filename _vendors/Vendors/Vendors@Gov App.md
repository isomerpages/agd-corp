Vendors@Gov App
===============

On 15 June 2016, AGD launched its first mobile application ("app") - the Vendors@Gov mobile app - to improve last-mile service delivery to vendors and bring the benefits of a Digital Government to the business community.

The key functionalities of the app include allowing vendors to view their e-invoice status on-the-go, check their projected cash flows and receive notifications, in addition to functions that already exist on the Vendors@Gov portal.

Vendors using the app are now able to receive timely information on their transactions instead of writing in to AGD's helpdesk system or checking their desktop computers. This alleviates the need for SMEs to incur administrative overheads/time spent to monitor cash flows from Government contracts, and to engage their clients on a more proactive basis to resolve outstanding e-invoices.

The app is currently available on both iOS and Android mobile platforms. For more details, please visitÂ [https://www.vendors.gov.sg/help/AboutMobileApp.aspx](https://www.vendors.gov.sg/help/AboutMobileApp.aspx).
