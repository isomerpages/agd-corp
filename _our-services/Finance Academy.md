Finance Academy
===============

The Finance Academy was set up in February 2016 to serve as the training arm of the Department. Since then, the focus of the Academy has expanded to include meeting the training needs of AGD officers to level up their professional capabilities in public sector finance and strengthening the finance capabilities of finance officers in the public sector.

  
The Finance Academy will collaborate with various stakeholders including the Civil Service College, MOF Specialist Development Office and the finance community in organizing relevant courses & events which include:

*   Internal Audit Courses in key areas such as Procurement, Grants Administration, and Payments as well as Raising Fraud Awareness;
*   Central Systems Training on NFS@Gov, Fi@Gov, etc. To allow end users to better understand and make use of key functionalities of the systems;
*   Finance and Technical Sessions focusing on core areas of professional development such as accounting standards, data analytics, emerging finance, professional ethics, etc.; and
*   Community Engagement Events to build a community of finance and internal audit practitioners to develop best practices in public sector finance.

The Academy will continue to embrace the community and together, we will level up the capabilities of the public sector finance officers.
