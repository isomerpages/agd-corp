<h1>Growth and  Development </h1>
<p></p>
<p>We have put in place an integrated learning and development framework
aimed at developing the professional competencies of our officers and strengthening
our career value proposition as an employer. The framework underpins our
commitment to nurture our people to their fullest potential.</p>

<p></p>
<p>As part of the career development programme, we have put in place a structured
posting process for AGD officers to systematically expand their competencies
across the wide range of central functions and responsibilities. Regular
career conversations will be conducted between AGD officers and their supervisors
to try to better match the personal aspirations of the officers with the
needs of the organisation.</p>
