<p>The sail, incorporated into the letter 'A', represents <strong>stability and stewardship</strong> that
our officers and central systems provide across Whole-Of-Government (WOG).It
embodies AGD's role as a steadfast guide in public sector finance, providing
a clear course through complex financial waters. Just as a sail harnesses
the wind to propel a ship forward, AGD leverages its expertise to drive
financial excellence across the public sector.</p>
<p>The butterfly, integrated into the letter 'D', is a symbol carried over
from our previous logo. It represents our commitment to <strong>adaptability and growth</strong>,
to enhance the value proposition of finance officers across WOG.</p>
<p>Just as a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, AGD continues to evolve,
taking on new roles and redefining existing responsibilities. The butterfly
also signifies our nurturing environment, where budding ideas and talented
officers can develop to their fullest potential.</p>
<p>Our updated colour palette adds <strong>depth, energy, and passion</strong> to
the logo. The darker blue represents our deepened expertise and the trust
we have built over the years, while the vibrant orangey-red injects a new
level of energy and passion into our brand. Together, these colors create
a powerful visual metaphor of our established foundation and our dynamic
approach to the future.</p>
