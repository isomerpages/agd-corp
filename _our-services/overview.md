### Our Financial Services - Raising Productivity Through Innovation

Over the years, we have expanded and transformed our portfolio of services by:

*   leveraging technologies to integrate our systems
*   making our processes increasingly paperless, accurate and efficient
*   improving the availability of our systems through various channels, including mobile applications
*   ensuring faster payment to government suppliers

These initiatives are a result of our efforts in raising productivity within the public sector finance.
