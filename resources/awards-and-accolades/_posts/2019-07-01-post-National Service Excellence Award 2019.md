National Service Excellence Award 2019

01 July 2019

“Behind every good-performing NSmen, there is a strong team of colleagues”

The NS Excellence Award (NSEA) recognises good performance during In-Camp Training or training courses.

We featured 4 AGD officers who have won the NSEA this year, and how their colleagues have played a big part in enabling them to effectively balance the demands of their dual roles as employees and NSmen.
