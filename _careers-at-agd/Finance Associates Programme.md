Finance Associates Programme
============================

The Finance Associates Programme is our flagship programme for new hires. The Programme allows our associates to systematically acquire strong foundations in key domain areas of finance, operations and policy formulation across the Whole-of-Government.  
  
Fresh graduates joining AGD under the programme will undergo a 12-month developmental phase comprising an expanded induction programme and 2 to 3 rotational stints of 4 - 6 months each across different finance functions. This will allow them to build up their competencies and accelerate career development as well as to take on leadership responsibilities early in their career.

### Expanded Induction Programme

The expanded induction programme comprises three modules - Basic, Foundational and Developmental – which the Finance Associates will undergo in their first year with AGD.  The different modules are specially tailored to equip our Associates with rudimentary concepts in Public Finance functions and to apply these concepts throughout their deployment stints.  
  
The Basic module, conducted at the start of the programme, will provide the Finance Associates with a broad overview of AGD’s central roles such as cash management, financial reporting, assurance and Value-For-Money reviews and financial administration.  
The Foundational module, conducted in between the deployment stints of the Finance Associates, will focus on the applications of key foundational financial knowledge and skillsets as well as soft skills developments through case studies and hands-on exercises.  
  
The Developmental module, conducted at the end of the 12-month programme, will introduce the Finance Associates to core personal and professional development areas through the sharing of best practices and chats with senior policy-makers and finance leaders.

### Deployment Stints

The deployment stints of Finance Associates will include attachments to AGD’s directorates to learn more about the central roles and functions fulfilled by AGD.  Some Finance Associates may also be attached to ministries and statutory boards to provide financial administration support.

### Mentoring

At the same time, we will assign mentors to all of our Finance Associates. Besides providing guidance on the professional development and career aspirations, the mentors will also help assess the performance and progress of associates.


### Post Associates Programme

There will be 2 to 3 structured postings, within AGD and/or the ministries and statutory boards, in the first six to seven years to equip Finance Associates with the necessary experiences and skillsets through a spectrum of functions and areas to prepare them to take on supervisory roles in the future.
